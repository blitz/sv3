A userspace switch for virtual machines.

* Prerequisites

  sv3 currently only supports Linux with Qemu/KVM as virtualization layer. It also needs
  a relatively recent kernel. Anything 3.x-ish should be okay.

* Building

** Qemu

The switch needs a patched qemu. Build it using:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
git submodule init
git submodule update

cd contrib/qemu
./configure --target-list=x86_64-softmmu --enable-kvm --disable-fdt
make
#+END_SRC

** Switch

   Execute =scons=. If you installed prerequisite libraries after you
   first scons run, you might have to do =scons --config=force=
   afterwards.

* Usage

** Starting a Guest

  Start the switch and attach a guest using:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
./sv3
# Switch to another terminal
export PATH=$PWD/contrib/qemu/x86_64-softmmu:$PATH
qemu-system-x86_64 -mem-path /tmp -net none -device externalpci,socket=/tmp/sv3 additional-args...
#+END_SRC

  Adding =-mem-path /tmp= to qemu is important, because it will create files there that
  serve as backing store for RAM.  */tmp should be a tmpfs!* If this is not the case,
  guest RAM will be periodically written to disk.

** Creating an Upstream Port

   By default, the switch is not connected to the outside world. You
   need an upstream port to do this. sv3 is able to drive network
   cards itself, but needs some preparation.

   If the PCI ID of the desired network card is 0000:02:00.1 and the
   user that runs the switch is john, use vfio-rebind.sh like this:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
sudo ./scripts/vfio-rebind.sh 0000:02:00.1 john
#+END_SRC

   This will unload the device's driver and attach it to vfio with
   access rights for john. The script might tell you to rebind unrelated devices
   as well to make the IOMMU happy.

   Currently, sv3 supports Intel 82599 10G "Niantic" NICs (sold as
   x520).

* Known Bugs

 - The switch will segfault, if passed file descriptors point to files that are too short.
 - The switch sometimes segfaults when clients disappear unexpectedly.

   #  L4 checksums are wrong in the presence of option headers. But this code is not used right now.
