A userspace switch for virtual machines.

* Prerequisites

  sv3 currently only supports Linux with Qemu/KVM as virtualization layer. It also needs
  a relatively recent kernel. Anything 3.x-ish should be okay.

* Building

** Qemu

The switch needs a patched qemu. Build it using:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
git submodule init
git submodule update

cd contrib/qemu
./configure --target-list=x86_64-softmmu --enable-kvm --disable-fdt
make
#+END_SRC

** Switch

   Execute =scons=. If you installed prerequisite libraries after you
   first scons run, you might have to do =scons --config=force=
   afterwards.

* Usage

  Start the switch and attach a guest using:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
./sv3
# Switch to another terminal
export PATH=$PWD/contrib/qemu/x86_64-softmmu:$PATH
qemu-system-x86_64 -mem-path /tmp -net none -device externalpci,socket=/tmp/sv3 additional-args...
#+END_SRC

  Adding =-mem-path /tmp= to qemu is important, because it will create files there that
  serve as backing store for RAM.  */tmp should be a tmpfs!* If this is not the case,
  guest RAM will be periodically written to disk.
